  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <h4>html.html</h4>

  <h3> Tags </h3>

  <p>
    Most of what we will be doing today will happen in a HTML document. HTML uses tags to structure content and define how they are presented. Usually they look somewhat like: <br/> <br/>
    &lt; tagname &gt; content &lt; /tagname &gt;
    <br/> <br/>
    Tags affect the content written between the tag opening and the tag closing (identifiable by the slash / ). Common tags are for example &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; for bold text, &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; for italic text, or &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; for paragraphs.
    <br/><br/>

    It is also possible to close a tag in the starting tag like here with this break line tag: &lt;br/&gt;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every HTML documents needs to include some boilerplate code:
  </p>
  <img src="images/html_boilerplate.png" width="400"/>

  <h3> Attributes </h3>
  <p>
    If you look in the source code, you will see that the boilerplate code has been included as an image. This is done with an &lt;img&gt;-tag. I have attached the image source with an attribute. Attributes provide additional information to a HTML-tag, have to be specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
    <br/><br/>
    We will use attributes to HTML tags frequently in the further tutorial.
